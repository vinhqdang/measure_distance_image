# How to use:

### Setup the environment:

The program is written in Python with two main libraries are SciPy and NumPy.

If you are not familiar with programming, I recommend you to use Anaconda or WinPython, which are ready - to - use Python bundle.

### Usage:

You should put the program and all PNG files in a same folder.

Open the command prompt in Windows, or terminal in Linux / Mac OS, move to the working directory and type:

python vinh.py PNG_file_name

to process one particular file

and

python vinh.py

to process all PNG files in the folder

The results will be stored in analyses directory.

### Notice:

If you chose WinPython, after install it, WinPython will give you a shortcut to its own command prompt in desktop. Use this shortcut to have a command line environment with ready Python.
